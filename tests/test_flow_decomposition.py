"""
The AUM decomposition is the claim the project is built on: that a fund's AUM
change can be split into what the market did and what investors did. The engine
had one smoke test that checked shapes, so the arithmetic itself was never
asserted anywhere. These pin it down.

Each case is built so the right answer is known by construction:
AUM is price times units, so moving one at a time isolates one side of the split.
