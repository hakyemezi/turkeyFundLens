## Classification Notes

- Classes are discovered by clustering window-averaged allocation vectors; class names are derived from each cluster centroid.
- `Confidence` is the margin between the nearest and second-nearest class, discounted by the share of the portfolio held in other funds.
- `Stability` is the share of sub-windows in which the fund stayed in its own class.
- `Style Drift` is the allocation distance between the first and last sub-window, in percentage points.
- Classification is descriptive analytics on published allocation data. It is not investment advice.
